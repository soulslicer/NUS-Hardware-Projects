# NUS Hardware Projects

These are just a few hardware projects I have worked on in various NUS modules. They are listed by module code and the reports for each of them will be uploaded soon

### EE2031

A module that teaches analog electronics. This circuit below models an easy to use portable radio station, complete with dual channel stero inputs, equalizers, LED meters and a tunable AM transmitter
